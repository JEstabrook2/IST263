        Hi, my name is <strong>James Estabrook</strong>. I am a senior EEE student within Whitman as well as having an IDS minor. 
        <br>
        I am from Middleboro, Massachusetts, about 45 minutes south of Boston, Massachusetts. <br> 
        I have gotten into the coding world through my work with a company called Best.Day.Ever., which focuses on corporate hospitality, and I handle analytics for us. Very excited to be taking this class.
