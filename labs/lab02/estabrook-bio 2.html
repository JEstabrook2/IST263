    <h1>James Estabrook Bio</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is <strong>James Estabrook</strong>. I am a senior EEE student within Whitman as well as having an IDS minor. 
        <br>
        I am from Middleboro, Massachusetts, about 45 minutes south of Boston, Massachusetts. I have gotten into the coding world through my work with a company called Best.Day.Ever., which focuses on corporate hospitality, and I handle analytics for us. Very excited to be taking this class.

    </p>

    <p> I am hoping to develop a landing page for myself throughout this class</p>
